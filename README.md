FilamATrix is a Stealthburner toolhead filament cutting mod created specifically for the ArmoredTurtle [BoxTurtle](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle) project.  It is an adaptation and cleanup of the [Filametrix](https://github.com/sorted01/Filametrix) and [G2E-Filametrix](https://github.com/IRTrail/G2E-Filametrix) mods. Note the slightly different spelling change - all other documentation within this repository refer to this specific modification.

However, use of BoxTurtle/AFC are not required - this mod can be used anywhere the upstream Filametrix/G2E-Filametrix are).

FilamATrix modifies the [VORON Design](https://www.vorondesign.com) [StealthBurner hotend and Clockwork 2 Extruder](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/) or [Galileo 2 Extruder](https://github.com/JaredC01/Galileo2/tree/main/galileo2_extruder) to support a kinematic-actuated cutting blade for cleaner, more reliable automated filament changes that also eliminates the need for tip forming.

FilamATrix consolidates the CAD for Filametrix and G2E-Filametrix into a single file and provides a reorganized repository with a clear structure of what files are needed to print.  While both extruders are provided as an option, our recommendation is to use Clockwork 2 - we find users have had the most success with it. The assembly instructions and manual only cover Clockwork 2.

Clockwork 2 supports two toolhead sensors, but some users may only be able to support one due to limited GPIO on the toolhead, so our default recommendation is just the pre-extruder sensor.

The print files for FilamATrix have been modified from the original projects with the following changes:

- Hotend mounts/Printheads now use M3 threaded heat insert (instead of a M3 nut) for simpler installation and maintenance.  Many thanks to [hartk](https://github.com/hartk1213) for this idea!<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix/refs/heads/main/images/m3_heat_insert_hotend.png" width=50%>

- On Clockwork 2, there is an increased depth for the PTFE tubing to better help guide the filament towards the extruder gears and make insertion less position dependent.<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix/refs/heads/main/images/cw2_section_analysis.png" width=50%>

- Cutting arm has been modified to support a full length M2.5x16 FHCS.

- Inclusion of the Beefy Depressor mount as the default.

## Supported hotends

## Assembly and Installation
Please review this [interactive manual](https://armoredturtle.xyz/manual.html?manual=filamatrix) for assembly and installation instructions of FilamATrix.

One thing to note is that the stock Stealthburner uses M3x25 SHCS for the upper screws securing the shroud to the extruder. The left screw need to be an **M3x20** SHCS on FilamATrix to allow the cutting arm to fully depress.

## Preparing and mounting of the Beefy Depressor

Install an M3 heatset on both sides of the beefy depressor pin. Attach the pin to the mount using the M3x16 FHCS. Thread the M3 hexnut onto the M3x16 BHCS and install that on the end facing into the printer.  Use the hexnut to 'lock' the screw into position, you may wish to use the Loctite or VC-3 here on this screw. Careful not to get Loctite on any ABS/ASA printed parts!

Attach the assembled mount to the gantry using M3 screws (place M3 washers between the screws and the printed part).  The length of the screw will likely be printer-dependent, see above BOM for suggested sizes.

Once installed, adjust the height of the pin on the mount and the depth of the screw so it will depress the cutting arm when the toolhead hits against it (going from right to left).

Depending on your printer you may find it more advantageous to mount the beefy depressor at the rear, or at the front.  See below for example mounting locations on an example Voron 2.4 printer gantry.

## AFC Configuration

Now that FilamATrix is installed, configure your software to leverage it.  If you are using the [AFC Klipper Add-On](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Klipper-Add-On),you'll need to configure the locations to actuate the cutter arm.
For further guidance you can also see the BoxTurtle [Initial Startup](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle/blob/main/Initial_Startup.md) guide.

If you are using other software, please refer to that project for the correct configuration.

- Home all printer axes (e.g., using G28)
- Use mainsail/fluidd/klipperscreen/etc controls to jog the toolhead near the cutting pin.  This will likely be near X minimum (e.g. X=15-20) and Y maximum if installed in the default location.
- Move the toolhead in 1mm increments until you are just about to depress the pin.  Make note of these coordinates.
- Continue to move the toolhead in 1mm increments until the cutting arm is fully depressed. Make a note of the fully depressed coordinates.
- Ensure ``tool_cut: true`` is set in ``AFC/AFC.cfg`` (it is also recommended to enable the park, kick, poop and wipe macros)
- Update ``AFC/AFC_Macro_Vars.cfg`` with these values as per the comments in the ``_AFC_CUT_TIP_VARS`` section.
