## Blade snapping jigs
The following jigs can be used to help snap the OLFA KB4-F/5 or Hobby #4 blades to length.  The regular versions are sized to 26mm, the shorter versions are 25mm. Install 4 M3 threaded heatset inserts into the bottom and secure the top and bottom sections with 4 M3x10 SHCS screws, sandwiching the blade between the top and bottom halves.  The sharp end of the blade goes into the jig, be careful - sharp things are sharp, avoid the soft squishy bleedy bits.

Once secured, put on eye protection and use a pair of pliers to snap the blade off at the entry point. You can then remove the screws and the blade, install the safety cap and proceed with the installation.
