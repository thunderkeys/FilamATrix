# Clockwork2 files

Print one each of:

- [\[a\]\_cutting_arm_clockwork2.stl](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/%5Ba%5D_cutting_arm_clockwork2.stl) OR [\[a\]\_cutting_arm_short_clockwork2.stl](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/%5Ba%5D_cutting_arm_short_clockwork2.stl)
- [\[a\]\_latch_ecas.stl](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/%5Ba%5D_latch_ecas.stl)
- [main_body_clockwork2_single_switch.stl](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/main_body_clockwork2_single_switch.stl) (recommended for AFC) OR [main_body_clockwork2_dual_switch.stl](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/main_body_clockwork2_dual_switch.stl) (recommended for HappyHare users)
- [cable_cover_pcb_w_sensor.stl](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/cable_cover_pcb_w_sensor.stl) OR [cable_cover_pcb.stl](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/cable_cover_pcb.stl)- the FilamATrix CW2 main body has more room for RP2040 SBB board plugs, and as such requires a newer cable cover mount.

If this is a new build, you will also need to print these upstream Clockwork2 files, which can be obtained from the [VORON Stealthburner repository](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/):

- [\[a\]\_guidler_a.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/Direct_Drive/%5Ba%5D_guidler_a.stl)
- [\[a\]\_guidler_b.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/Direct_Drive/%5Ba%5D_guidler_b.stl)
- [\[a\]\_latch_shuttle.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/Direct_Drive/%5Ba%5D_latch_shuttle.stl)
- [motor_plate.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/Direct_Drive/motor_plate.stl)
- [chain_anchor_2hole.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/chain_anchor_2hole.stl) or [chain_anchor_3hole.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/chain_anchor_3hole.stl) if using cable chains

If you are using an older, pre-release version of Clockwork 2 you will also need to print a new [motor_plate.stl](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner/blob/main/STLs/Clockwork2/Direct_Drive/motor_plate.stl).  In the image below, pre-release is in red, current release is green. See the circled areas for the main change areas to inspect.
